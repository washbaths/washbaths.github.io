<font color="green">No. If there is a waitlist, the only way to add your name is in-person.</font color="green"><br><br>

When is it least busy?<br>

<font color="green"> We do not offer memberships. We do however offer multiple-entry pass cards in 5 and 10 entry amounts. Pass cards reduce the price per entry. Pass cards may be punched twice per visit (if you have a guest or want to share a pass card between two people). Pass cards never expire.</font color="green"><br><br>

What are the temperatures of the saunas and pools?<br>
<font color="green"> The hot pool is 104F, the cold pool is 50F. The air temperature in the sauna fluctuates depending on a range of factors, but is generally between 180F-200F. </font color="green"><br><br>

What kind of sauna is it?<br>
<font color="green"> The saunas are heated by a once-fired, traditional-style thermal mass heater. The kiuas (stove) can be fired with gas or wood. Because of the large quantity of masonry and stone inide of the stove, the saunas benefit from three kinds of heat transfer: convection (hot air), evaporation and condensation (steam), and radiation (light). These different kinds of heat transfer combine to produce a smooth yet powerful thermal expereience in the body. </font color="green"><br><br>

Can I pour water on the rocks?<br>
<font color="green"> Yes. The kiuas is designed to allow for water to be poured on the hot rocks to produce steam. There is a small hole in the top of the stove where water should be directed. Pour slowly to produce the best steam. It is polite to ask your fellow bathers if they would like more steam before adding water. Too much water will "drown" the rocks and decrease the heat from the rocks and the quality of the steam. </font color="green"><br><br>

What is the sanitation system for the pools?<br>
<font color="green">We take great care to ensure superior water cleanliness and quality. We use a state-of-the-art purification system, utilizing ultraviolet light, ozone, and chlorine to treat our water. We conduct daily tests and replace the pool water entirely each week. </font color="green"><br><br>

How long can I stay?<br>
<font color="green">There is no time limit. A typical visit lasts 1.5 - 2hrs.</font color="green"><br><br>

Can I bring a group?<br>
<font color="green">We discourage groups, however if you plan to come with friends, please limit your group size to 5 or less. We will not add groups to the waitlist.</font color="green"><br><br>

Is there a recommended order or sequence? How long should I stay in the sauna?<br>
<font color="green">There is no correct order or sequence. Each person will find their own personal rhythm. The important thing is to listen to your body. When you are too hot it is time to cool down, when you are too cold it is time to warm up. Very simple. <br><br>That said, for those looking for a place to start, it could go something like this: (1) shower, (2) enter the sauna for 10-15 minutes, (3) cool off with cold water basin, cold plunge, or cold shower, (4) rest for 15 minutes, (5) repeat for 3 cycles, (6) end your session with some time in the hot pool, (7) drink water and have a snack! <br><br>It is important to hydrate, before, during and after your sauna session. Also enure that you allow adequate time for resting between cycles. A good rule of thumb is to rest outside of the sauna for the same amount of time that you spend in the sauna.</font color="green"><br><br>

I'm nervous that I've been in the sauna too long... how do I know?<br>
<font color="green">A good check-in to do with yourself is to listen to your heartbeat. If you can feel your heart beating rapidly, it’s probably your body telling you it’s time to take a rest from the heat. Pay attention to how you feel and you’ll be fine.</font color="green"><br><br>

I've heard it is a silent space?<br>
<font color="green">Silence is oberved on Fridays only. On all other days you are welcome to chat anywhere in the facility, we simply ask that you be mindful of your volume, and conscientious of your fellow bathers. </font color="green"><br><br>

Do you have a lost and found?<br>
<font color="green">Yes we do. If we find a lost item we wash it and put it in our lost and found. Due to the high volume of lost and found we can only keep things around for a week or so. Pleae come retreive your lost item as soon as possible. Washington Baths is not responsible for lost or stolen items. </font color="green"><br><br>

I hear you can get a massage - how does that work?<br>
<font color="green">Sandra Benson operates a massage therapy practice upstairs—<a href="http://www.magnoliahealingarts.com" target="_blank">Magnolia Healing Arts</a>. It is a separate business from the baths. If you are interested you can visit her website for more information and to make contact. If Sandra doesn't have an immediate opening, you will be able to join their waitlist.</font color="green"><br><br>

Can I just take a quick look around or get a tour?<br>
<font color="green">To respect the privacy of our bathers we do not offer tours. If you are curious, the best way to explore the space is to come try it out yourself!</font color="green"><br><br>

What is the sound system?<br>
<font color="green">The speakers in the lounge are 1969 Klipschorns upgraded with Crites crossovers, tweeters, and squawkers, powered with a McIntosh 2100 power amp and a McIntosh preamp. The speakers in the cafe are Ojas Artbook Shelf speakers powered with a McIntosh preamp and Elekit TU-800 SIT tube amp. </font color="green"><br><br>
