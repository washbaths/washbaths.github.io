In solidarity with the International Call for a Global Shutdown for Palestine<br>
Washington Baths will be closed today.<br><br>

We cannot simply continue on with business as usual.<br>
We must recognize the atrocities and war crimes that are being committed<br>
with active complicity from our elected leaders, using our weapons,<br>
with our security and defense as justification. <br>
We must stop. <br><br>

We are demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, <br>
and an end to the occupation and apartheid in the <br>
Occupied Palestinian Territories. <br><br>
